Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what is missing
or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests against our master branch
for new features or bug fixes.

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the ascat repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the ascat master branch
- add your feature
- please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
