Readers and converters for data acquired by the ASCAT sensor on-board the MetOP
satellites. Written in Python.

Works great in combination with `pytesmo <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo>`_.

Supported Products
==================

This give a short overview over the supported products. Please see the
documentation for detailed examples of how to work with a product.

Read ASCAT data from different sources into a common format supported by pytesmo

Time Series Products
--------------------

* ASCAT SSM(Surface Soil Moisture) Time Series

  Available in netCDF format from `H-SAF
  <http://hsaf.meteoam.it/soil-moisture.php>`_ (H25 product)


* ASCAT SWI(Soil Water Index) Time Series

  Available in binary format from `TU Wien <http://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/products/>`_

Image products
--------------

`H-SAF <http://hsaf.meteoam.it/soil-moisture.php>`_ provides several different
image products:

* SM OBS 1 - H07 - Large scale surface soil moisture by radar scatterometer in
  BUFR format over Europe
* H16 - SSM ASCAT-B NRT O : Metop-B ASCAT soil moisture 12.5km sampling NRT
* H103 - SSM ASCAT-B NRT O : Metop-B ASCAT soil moisture 25km sampling NRT
* H101 - SSM ASCAT-A NRT O : Metop-A ASCAT soil moisture 12.5km sampling NRT
* H102 - SSM ASCAT-A NRT O : Metop-A ASCAT soil moisture 25km sampling NRT
* SM OBS 2 - H08 - Small scale surface soil moisture by radar scatterometer in
  BUFR format over Europe
* SM DAS 2 - H14 - Profile index in the roots region by scatterometer data
  assimilation in GRIB format, global

The products H07, H16, H101, H102, H103 come in BUFR format and can be read by
the same reader. So examples for the H07 product are equally valid for the other
products.

They are available after registration from the `H-SAF Website
<http://hsaf.meteoam.it/soil-moisture.php>`_

Installation
============

The packages you have to install depend on the features you want to use. The
H-SAF image products are disseminated in BUFR (H07, H16, H103, H101, H102, H08)
or GRIB (H14) format. So to read them you will have to install the appropriate
packages which will be explained shortly. Unfortunately neither BUFR nor GRIB
readers work on Windows so if you need these formats then Linux or OS X are your
only options.

For installation we recommend `Miniconda
<http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_. So please install it according to
the official installation instructions. As soon as you have the ``conda``
command in your shell you can continue.

The following script will download and install all the needed packages.

.. code::

    conda create -q -n ascat python=2 numpy pandas netCDF4 pytest pip pyproj
    source activate ascat
    conda install -c cpaulik pybufr-ecmwf # for reading BUFR files
    conda install -c conda-forge pygrib=2.0.1 # for reading GRIB files
    pip install ascat

This script should work on Windows, Linux or OSX but on Windows you will get
errors for the installation commands of pybufr-ecmwf and pygrib.


Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what is missing
or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests against our master branch
for new features or bug fixes.

Development setup
-----------------

For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
including test dependencies and debugger by running ``conda env create -f
environment.yml``. This will create a new ``ascat-dev`` environment which you
can activate by using ``source activate ascat-dev``.

Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the ascat repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the ascat master branch
- add your feature
- please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
